# SLRSyncUploader
Silverlight Uploader with RSync Functionality
Many moons ago, a attempt to understand how RSync did it's magic. A way to 'synchronize' large files with minimal changes. Uses a number of concepts ranging from 'sliding window' hashing to comparing strong hashes. 
Also an early implementation of asynchronous code and processing VERY large files with a minimal memory footprint. 
Oh and the 'Silverlight' bit was aspirational (at the time). Was the only way to traverse fioes on a local file system at the tie.
